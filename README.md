## üñ•Ô∏è System Info

- **OS**: Windows 11 Pro 24H2 (Build 26100.3476)
- **Goal**: Install WSL2 and Ubuntu 24.04

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Errors Encountered

- `wsl_update_x64.msi` fails with: `This update only applies to machines with the Windows Subsystem for Linux`  
- DISM stuck or returns:
  - `Erro: 50` ‚Üí "Operation completed but feature was not enabled"
  - `Erro: 14107` ‚Üí "One or more members of the transaction are not present"

## ‚úÖ Final Working Steps

### 1. Run System File Check
This step **fixed everything**. It restores missing/corrupt system components required by WSL:

```powershell
sfc /scannow
```
- After the scan, **REBOOT** your machine.

### 2. Enable WSL & Virtualization Features

```powershell
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:HypervisorPlatform /all /norestart
```

Reboot again.

### 3. Verify Feature Activation

```powershell
dism.exe /online /get-features /format:table | findstr /i "Virtual Hyper"
```
Expected output:
```
VirtualMachinePlatform       | Habilitado
HypervisorPlatform           | Habilitado
```

### 4. Install the Latest WSL Manually (Optional if wsl --install fails)
Download the latest `.msixbundle` from [WSL Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/releases).

```powershell
Add-AppxPackage .\Microsoft.WSL_2.4.13.0_x64_ARM64.msixbundle
```

### 5. Install Ubuntu 24.04

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```
‚úÖ Success message:
```
Installing: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
Distribution installed successfully. You can start it using 'wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-24.04'
```

## ‚ú® Tips

- Make sure virtualization is enabled in BIOS.
- `sfc /scannow` may resolve hidden system corruption blocking WSL features.
- You can install WSL from the Microsoft Store *only* after required features are fully functional.
